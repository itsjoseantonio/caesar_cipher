# Caesar Cipher Exercise

## Introduction
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## Description
This exercise involves implementing a Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Ruby. The algorithm should take a plaintext message and a shift value as input and output the corresponding encrypted or decrypted message.

## Example
For example, with a left shift of 3:
- 'A' becomes 'X'
- 'B' becomes 'Y'
- 'C' becomes 'Z'
- 'D' becomes 'A'
- 'E' becomes 'B'
- and so on.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `caesar_cipher.rb` file in a text editor.
3. Implement the `caesar_cipher` method according to the instructions provided in the comments.
4. Test your implementation with various plaintext messages and shift values.
